            <p>I like to experience new things and go to new places. These years I live in San Diego and I enjoy to explore new places and restaurants here. I like listen to music during my free time. Sometime, I'll play the guitar and sing by myself.
                I also like to cook yummy food. Sometimes I'll making cake for my family. Eating delicious food make me happy. One thing I like most is to do jigsaw puzzle. I finished 3 puzzle with 1000 pieces last quarter.
