            <p>Hi, my name is Jingxian Wang. I'm an undergraduate student in <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>. <strong>My major is Computer Science.</strong> This is the first line of code I learned to write in computer science.</p>

            <p>I come from Henan, China. Henan is in Central China's Yellow River Valley. It is an ancient province. There are beautiful landscape, historical culture and a lot of delicious food.

            <p>I like to experience new things and go to new places. These years I live in San Diego and I enjoy to explore new places and restaurants here. I like listen to music during my free time. Sometime, I'll play the guitar and sing by myself.
                I also like to cook yummy food. Sometimes I'll making cake for my family. Eating delicious food make me happy. One thing I like most is to do jigsaw puzzle. I finished 3 puzzle with 1000 pieces last quarter.
